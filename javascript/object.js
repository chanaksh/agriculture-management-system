      Climate:"<br>Onion is a temperate crop but can be grown under a wide range of climatic conditions such as temperate, tropical and subtropical climate.<br> The best performance can be obtained in a mild weather without the extremes of cold and heat and excessive rainfall.<br> However, onion plant is hardy and in the young stage can withstand freezing temperature also.<br> In India, short-day onion is grown in the plains and requires 10-12 hours day length. <br>The long-day onion is grown in hills requiring 13-14 hours day length.<br> For vegetative growth, lower temperature combined with short photoperiod is required whereas relatively higher temperature along with longer photoperiod is required for bulb development and maturity. The optimum temperature for vegetative phase and bulb development is 13-24˚C and 16-25˚C, respectively. It requires about 70% relative humidity for good growth. It can grow well in places where the average annual rainfall is 650-750 mm with good distribution during the monsoon period. Areas with low (< 650 mm) or heavy rainfall (>750 mm) are not particularly suitable for rain-fed crop.</p>",

The potato is a crop which has always been the ‘poor man’s friend’. Potato is <br>being cultivated in the country for the last more than 300 years. For vegetable purposes it has become one of the most popular crops in this country. Potatoes are an economical food; they provide a source of low cost energy to<br> the human diet. Potatoes are a rich source of starch, vitamins especially C and B1 and minerals. They contain 20.6 per cent carbohydrates, 2.1 per cent protein, 0.3 per cent fat, 1.1 per cent crude fibre and 0.9 per cent ash.<br> They also contain a good amount of essential amino acids like leucine, tryptophane and isoleucine etc. Potatoes are used for several industrial purposes such as for the production of starch and alcohol.<br> Potato starch (farina) is used in laundries and for sizing yarn in textile mills. Potatoes are also used for the production of dextrin and glucose. As a food product itself, potatoes are converted into dried products such as ‘potato chips’, ‘sliced’ or ‘shredded <br>potatoes’. It is a much branched bushy herb, usually 0.5 to 1m in height possesing underground stems bearing the edible tubers. The leaves are odd pinate with a large terminal leaflet. It flowers in cymose panicles.<br> Potato is grown almost in all states of India. However, the major potato rowing states are Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, West Bengal, Bihar and Assam.",

Symptoms are evident in wet weather, when bacterial exudate flows from the wounds.<br> This (the exudate) is installed on the seeds, in the soil and on the vegetal remains, ensuring the transmission of the bacteriosis.",

    Climate: "Cucumber is a warm season crop that grows best at a daily mean temperature of 18-24°C, however, the most ideal growing temperature is 27.8°C. Optimum growth takes place at 15°C temperature and 80-90% relative humidity but temperature above 32.2°C and below 15.6°C causes slow growth. The seeds germinate well at 27°C. Environmental factors significantly influence the sex expression in cucumbers.<br>In general, increased plant population, high temperature, long days, low humidity, low moisture regime and high fertility especially nitrogen tend to increase staminate flowers,<br> while decreased plant populations, low temperature, short days, high humidity, high moisture regime and low fertility especially nitrogen promote pistillate flowers.",
  Soil: "Cucumber can be grown on a wide range of soil types, provided they are well drained and fertile. Sandy-loam to loam soils rich in organic matter are most suitable for its cultivation,<br> but early yield can be obtained from crop sown on light soils, while soils having moderate texture give ideal harvest. In heavy soils, growth is adversely affected because of poor drainage.<br> It is well known that cucumber is fairly tolerant to acid soils, but the best growth is obtained in soils having pH range from 6.0 to 7.0. The minimum acid tolerant limit of soil for cucumber cultivation is pH 5.0.",

  IntroDescription: "Cucumis includes about 30 species of annuals and herbaceous perennials of the Old World tropics and warm temperate regions. Among them cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.)<br> is one of the most important commercial crops grown extensively throughout India, however, China leads in average production followed by India, the USSR, the US and various European countries.<br>The fresh taste and aroma of the cucumber are determined by free organic acid and essential oils present in it. Takei and Ono (1939) attributed that flavor of cucumber is said to be derived mainly from the 2,6 nonadienal,<br> with assistance from 2-hexenal, the more astringent taste being contributed by 2-noenal.",

      Description1: "This disease more commonly affects melons but can also affect cucumbers. The fungal spores can be carried in by wind or spread through contaminated soil and water. Wet and warm conditions favor the disease.<br> The fungus can survive the winter in plant debris to attack the plants again in the spring.",

      Description2: "Another fungal disease, anthracnose is most prevalent in wet and warm conditions. Regions with high humidity like southern and mid-Atlantic states are highly susceptible to fungal plant diseases.<br>The fungus overwinters in fallen vines, leaves, and other plant debris, releasing spores in the spring to infect new plants.<br> The spores (conidia) need moisture and mild temperatures to germinate.",

      Description4: "Bacterial wilt is spread mainly through cucumber beetles (striped and spotted). The cucumber beetle is a small insect—yellow in color with either black stripes or spots on its back.<br> It picks up the bacteria while feeding on infected cucumbers and transfers them to other plants in the same manner. The bacteria survive winters by living in their beetles' guts.",

{Climate: "Carrots thrive in temperate climatic conditions. They require cool temperatures for optimal growth, preferably between 15°C and 20°C. However, they can tolerate a wide range of temperatures, from 10°C to 25°C.<br> Carrots require well-drained soil with a pH level between 6.0 and 7.0. They prefer loose, sandy loam soil that is rich in organic matter.",
Soil: "Before sowing carrot seeds, it is essential to prepare the soil properly. Begin by removing any weeds and debris from the field. Carrots require loose soil with good drainage.<br> Therefore, the soil should be tilled and broken down to a fine tilth.

    Description1: " The disease produce severe blighting on carrot leaves and petioles if wet weather is prolonged during the growing season. Entire leaves and petioles may die on severely infected plants.<br> The symptoms first appear along the margins of the leaves, often causing the leaves to curl. Spots inside the leaf edges are small, roughly circular, and tan or gray to brown with a dead center.<br> As the lesions increase in number and size, the entire leaflet withers and dies. The fungus attacks younger leaves and plants in preference to older ones. In heavily infested fields, however, both lder and younger leaves are subject to attack. <br>The pathogen also produces lesions on the petioles and stems. The lesions may merge and girdle the stems, causing the leaves to die. Control: The leaf blight pathogens can survive from one year to the next in infected plant debris.<br> Therefore, a two-to three-year rotation is recommended to allow for natural decline in the pathogen population. The use of disease-free seed is strongly recommended because the fungus can survive on or in the seed. <br>Early applications of Foltaf (0.2%), Copper Oxychloride (0.3%), starting at the first sign of infection, effectively control leaf blights on carrots.<br> Best control is achieved when fungicides are applied at high pressure and in sufficient water to reach the lower leaves in a dense canopy",

    Description2: "Alternaria leaf spots first appear at the margin of the leaflets and are dark brown to black and irregular in shape. Lesions produced on the petioles and stems are dark brown and often coalesce and girdle the <br>tems. As the disease progresses entire leaflets may shrivel and die, appearing scorched. Alternaria leaf lesions are generally more prevalent on older foliage and plants than on young foliage. The disease spreads rapidly on the older <br>leaves of a maturing crop after the rows have closed. This is due in part to poor air circulation among the older lower leaves in the canopy and to the moisture-holding capacity of the dense foliage. <br>Control:<br> The disease can be kept under check if a well-drained soil is selected and suitable crop rotation is adopted.  Since the fungus can survive in the seed, hot water treatment at 50°C for 15 minutes is recommended.<br> Seed treatment with Thiram (3g/kg of seed) before sowing is effective to control the disease. Crop rotation and destruction of infected plant material in the field will minimize the disease infection, <br>Fungicidal applications with Foltaf (0.2%), Copper Oxychloride (0.3%) satisfactorily controls the disease.",

    Description3: " The symptoms appear as white powdery growth on the leaves and petioles causing the leaves to turn brown and wilt.<br>Control: <br>Spraying Bavistin (0.1%) or Benlate (0.1%) at an interval of 8-10 days effectively controls the disease.",

    Description4:"Carrots are susceptible to this disease, especially late in the season and during storage. The disease is present in soil or storage areas and often shows up after the crop has been harvested.<br> Symptoms can be dentified in the field as characteristic white mold with black sclerotia present on the crown of infected carrots. In storage, a soft, watery rot with white mold and black sclerotia characterizes the disease.<br> Control: Crop rotation, weed control (to improve air circulation), planting on raised beds, winter flooding, rapid cooling prior to storage and meticulous sanitation of all storage components are all necessary to reduce losses from this disease.",
